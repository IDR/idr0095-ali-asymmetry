Study Title	Inherent regulatory asymmetry emanating from network architecture in a prevalent autoregulatory motif

Study Type	metabolic network measurement

Study Type Term Source REF	EFO	
						
Study Type Term Accession	EFO_0009864

Study Description	Predicting gene expression from DNA sequence remains a major goal in the field of gene regulation. A challenge to this goal is the connectivity of the network, whose role in altering gene expression remains unclear. Here, we study a common autoregulatory network motif, the negative single-input module, to explore the regulatory properties inherited from the motif. Using stochastic simulations and a synthetic biology approach in E. coli, we find that the TF gene and its target genes have inherent asymmetry in regulation, even when their promoters are identical; the TF gene being more repressed than its targets. The magnitude of asymmetry depends on network features such as network size and TF binding affinities. Intriguingly, asymmetry disappears when the growth rate is too fast or too slow and is most significant for typical growth conditions. These results highlight the importance of accounting for network architecture in quantitative models of gene expression.

# Protocols																						
Protocol Name
growth protocol: Bacterial cultures are grown overnight in 1 mL of LB in a 37°C incubator shaking at 250 rpm. Cultures grown overnight are diluted 2.5* 10^3 fold into 1 mL of fresh M9
minimal media supplemented with 0.5% of Glucose, allowed to grow at 37°C until they reach an OD600 of 0.2 to 0.4 and harvested for microscopy.  

treatment protocol:  Cells are diluted 1:3 in 1X PBS (in order to obtain isolated cells in microscope images) and 1μL is spotted on a 2% low melting agarose pad (Invitrogen #16520050)
 made with 1X PBS.

image acquistion and feature extraction protocol: An automated fluorescent microscope (Nikon TI-E) with a heating chamber set at 37°C is used to record multiple fields per sample (between
6-12 unique fields of view). Each field is imaged using Phase, mCherry and YFP channels. 

data analysis protocol: Data analysis is performed using a modi1ed version of the Matlab code Schnitzcells (Rosenfeld et al. (2005)). We use this code to segment the phase images of each sample to identify single cells. Mean pixel intensities of YFP and mCherry signals are extracted from the segmented phase mask for each individual cell using regionprops, an inbuilt function in matlab. The background fluorescence is calculated by averaging the mean intensity of the inverse phase mask upon eroding the regions around the segmented cell masks. The background fluorescence value of a particular frame was subtracted from the mean pixel intensity of cells in the same frame. Finally, the autofluorescence value were calculated using the same procedure for cells that do not express either YFP or mCherry and the average autofluorescence value of these cells is subtracted from each measured YFP or mCherry value. Resulting mean pixel intensity of mCherry signal was corrected for the crosstalk from YFP signal. Crosstalk between different channels can be measured by determining the difference between the autofluorescence of a strain without a given fluorophore in the presence of the other fluorophore (highly expressed). We find that under our microscope 0.25% (cross = 0:0025) of YFP signals can be seen in the mCherry channel whereas mCherry channel has no crosstalk in the YFP channel. Hence, we correct for this crosstalk by subtracting the mean pixel intensity of YFP signal times the cross from the mean pixel intensity of mCherry signal. The per-pixel fluorescence values of mCherry and YFP of each cell is then multiplied by the area of the cell to account for the total fluorescence. Fold-change in expression of the mCherry and YFP is calculated by dividing the corresponding values of the constitutive strains. Bootstrapped mean and standard deviation of the bootstrapped means are calculated for each sample.
